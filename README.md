Springboot + Kronos + JDK 17 + Maven + Kotlin 2.0.0

## Introduction
This is a simple Springboot application that uses Kronos.

If you want to know more about Kronos, please visit [Kronos](https://www.kotlinor.com/).

After run the application, you can access the following URL to see the result:
```
http://localhost:8080
```

If the result returned by the interface is as shown in the figure below, it means that Kronos has been successfully run and the compiler plug-in has worked properly.
